  Using this is pretty simple, but there are certain important things you must keep in mind. First, lets see how to actually implement this into your Chrome Browser.
</p>

  <li>Select load unpacked from the options. </li>
  <li>Now it should be ready to work with!</li>
  <li>If theres any issue, feel to contact me!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Usage INstructions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Open the Extension</li>
  <li>Type in the name of the website</li>
  <li>Click on block</li>
  <li>A message should appear below. </li>
  <li>After that, open a new tab and try to open the website. It will load for 1 or 2 seconds, but then it will show as blank. </li>
  <li>
    To unblock, its a bit of a probem. You have to go the blocker, type the name of the site again and block it. Then without closing the popup, type the name of the webiste again, and click on unblock. That will be fixed in future updates.
  </li>
</ul>
